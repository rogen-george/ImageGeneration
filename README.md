Image Generation Using Generative Models : Generating new Anime Faces and Atari Screens using MADE and Gaussian Mixture Models

Unsupervised learning is a section under artificial intelligence that has gained a lot of traction over the past few years. It has found implementation in different and diverse fields, right from regenerating images to modelling text. One principled approach to unsupervised learning is generative probabilistic modelling, of which Density Estimation finds itself to be a major component. This report goes over the intuition and math behind density estimation, implements these concepts in the form of Masked Auto-regressive Density Estimation (MADE) models, and systematically conducts experiments with different MNIST, Atari and Anime data so as to evaluate our hypothesis outlined in the methodology of MADE.
